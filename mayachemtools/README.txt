INTRODUCTION

MayaChemTools is a growing collection of Perl scripts, modules, and classes
to support day-to-day computational discovery needs.

The current release of MayaChemTools provides command line scripts for
the following tasks: Manipulation of SD, CSV/TSV, Sequence/Alignments,
and PDB files; Analysis of data in SD, CSV/TSV, and Sequence/Alignments
files; Information about data in SD, CSV/TSV, Sequence/Alignments, PDB,
and fingerprints files; Exporting data from Oracle and MySQL tables into text
files Properties of periodic table elements, amino acids, and nucleic acids;
Elemental analysis;Generation of fingerprints corresponding to atom
neighborhoods, atom types, E-state indicies, extended connectivity,
MACCS keys, path lengths, topological atom pairs, topological atom triplets,
topological atom torsions, topological pharmacophore atom pairs, and
topological pharmacophore atom triplets; Generation of fingerprints
with atom types corresponding to atomic invariants, DREIDING, E-state,
functional class, MMFF94, SLogP, SYBYL, TPSA and UFF; Calculation of
similarity matrices using a variety of similarity and distance coefficients;
Calculation of physicochemical properties including rotatable bonds,
van der Waals molecular volume, hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond
acceptors, SLogP, TPSA, molecular complexity and so on; Similarity
searching using fingerprints.

Review the documentation for further details.
